      <h1>Equitable AI for Financial Inclusion</h1>
      <h2> The first step to change is awareness. </h2>
    </header>
      <p>
        The digital divide significantly influences financial inclusion as advanced technologies continue to become publicly accessible. With services like investment robo-advisors being increasingly used, users lacking access to technology may struggle to effectively leverage these resources, thus exacerbating the investment knowledge gap. Further, the presence of algorithmic bias in financial AI systems used by top companies means that technologies can reinforce socioeconomic disparities by perpetuating human prejudice against marginalized groups. </p>

          <p> Raising awareness on the relationships between financial gaps and biased AI-systems are crucial to making advantages delivered by these technologies accessible.  </p>
