          <h1> Contact Your Senator </h1>
      <br>
          <p id="call"> In July 2023, the House introduced the H.R.4503 - AI Training and Expansion Act. The goal of this bill is to expand AI training within the executive branch of the Federal Government. If passed, the bill would extend the requirements for artificial intelligence (AI) training within the federal executive branch. Specifically, it mandates that employees in acquisition, management, supervising, and technology positions must learn about fundamental AI definitions and applications, potential benefits and risks, the influence of datasets in AI models, and strategies for executive agencies implementing AI. </p>
      <br>
          <p id="call"> Your action item today is to call or email your Senator to tell them about your concerns regarding data privacy in artificial intelligence and encourage them to support H.R.4503 - AI Training and Expansion Act. With our government officials being equipped with the information to understand AI, there are more opportunities for legislation promoting equitable artificial intelligence</p>
